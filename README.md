# About JobMe

JobMe is a website that simplifies the job application process. After creating an account, users can:

- Keep track of information that is commonly requested on applications in their profile tab

- Add applications and view them in an application log

- Easily track upcoming job interviews

Applications are organized by status (To Do / In Progress / Completed) to help users keep track of their progress on their job search. Each application can store the Company Name, Position, Job Posting Link, Deadline, and more. Additionally, user interviews are separated into past and upcoming interviews to keep users looking forward.

# Installation
